Update of $$$s mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622501189

- Updated the price since the Vanilla turret is more expensive now
- Works well with the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2339394453]Advanced Mini-Turret+ mod by velcroboy333
- Seems enemies will now use the mortars as well, if they can afford them
- Uses the reinforced barrel-mechanic if enabled, same as vanilla mortars.

Adds upgraded version of the mortar. Details are attatched as images. 

For players only. Enemies won't bring this to attack you.

Burst fire is not free.
It consumes a shell per each shot.
It's working just like a following video.
